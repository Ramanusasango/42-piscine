       LLaasstt searches back through the file //vvaarr//lloogg//wwttmmpp (or the file designated by the --ff flag) and displays a list
       of all users logged in (and out) since that file was created.  Names of users and  tty's  can  be  given,  in
       which  case llaasstt will show only those entries matching the arguments.  Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus
       llaasstt 00 is the same as llaasstt ttttyy00.

       When llaasstt catches a SIGINT signal (generated by the interrupt key, usually control-C)  or  a  SIGQUIT  signal
       (generated  by  the quit key, usually control-\), llaasstt will show how far it has searched through the file; in
       the case of the SIGINT signal llaasstt will then terminate.

       The pseudo user rreebboooott logs in each time the system is rebooted.  Thus llaasstt rreebboooott will show  a  log  of  all
       reboots since the log file was created.

       LLaassttbb  is  the  same as llaasstt, except that by default it shows a log of the file //vvaarr//lloogg//bbttmmpp, which contains
       all the bad login attempts.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ff _f_i_l_e
              Tells llaasstt to use a specific file instead of //vvaarr//lloogg//wwttmmpp.

       --_n_u_m   This is a count telling llaasstt how many lines to show.

       --nn _n_u_m The same.

       --tt _Y_Y_Y_Y_M_M_D_D_H_H_M_M_S_S
              Display the state of logins as of the specified time.  This is useful, e.g., to determine  easily  who
              was logged in at a particular time -- specify that time with --tt and look for "still logged in".

       --RR     Suppresses the display of the hostname field.

       --aa     Display the hostname in the last column. Useful in combination with the next flag.

       --dd     For  non-local  logins,  Linux  stores  not only the host name of the remote host but its IP number as
              well. This option translates the IP number back into a hostname.

       --FF     Print full login and logout times and dates.

       --ii     This option is like --dd in that it displays the IP number of the remote host, but it  displays  the  IP
              number in numbers-and-dots notation.

       --oo     Read an old-type wtmp file (written by linux-libc5 applications).

       --ww     Display full user and domain names in the output.

       --xx     Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  files  _w_t_m_p  and  _b_t_m_p  might  not be found. The system only logs information in these files if they are
       present. This is a local configuration issue. If you want the files to be used, they can be  created  with  a
       simple ttoouucchh(1) command (for example, _t_o_u_c_h _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_w_t_m_p).
